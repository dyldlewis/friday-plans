**PLANS FOR TODAY**


Today I plan to do a lot of reading, LinkedIn/Cover Letter/Resume work, and mainly focus on vocabulary and communicating my ideas in a way that is professional, accurate, and easy to understand. There's also a really cool open source documentary I'd like to watch, along with a short-film on intellectual property. In addition, I'd like to refactor my social-media clone to use redux.

**IDEAS FOR FOLLOWING WEEKS**

There's four main ideas that I really want to focus on before I start my internship. It really seems like a lot but I'm determined to have a decent understaning of each.

1. API's in react
.
2. [User authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIajENrOJ0o&t=89s) with Redux.
3. Using a back end language with a database like ReThink or Mongo.
4. Life cycle methods. I really feel like I don't have a firm under
standing of when I'd use each one.


**WHAT I NEED TO SUCCEED**

As I mentioned earlier in the README, I really want to hone in on speaking code code really well. I'm making some flash cards containing JSX terms, HTTP terms, and common programming vocab.
